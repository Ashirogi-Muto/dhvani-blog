						Not all vibrations that produce sound are intelligible or pleasing
						to the ear. We hear sounds around us all the time yet most of it is
						not really pleasing to the ear as compared to hearing musical sound.
						Why is that? the sound of music (organised sound) or tone has
						regular vibrations while noise (not organised) has irregular pattern
						of vibrations. नाद (Nāda) is the musical sound in the Indian
						classical music but also has spiritual and philosophical
						connotations. The reason why music sounds pleasing but not noise is
						due to Math. Human brains are pattern finding machines. Our brains
						evolved to reward us for the simple frequency ratios likely due to
						survival mechanism to detect regular non-threatening patterns in the
						environment. But sometimes we apply the same preference for
						mathematical symmetry and consonance into the realm of music for
						purely aesthetic purposes. The pleasure we derive from harmonic
						sounds is an example of taking an adaptive trait (pattern
						recognition) and redirecting it towards non-essential, cultural
						pursuits like music composition and appreciation.

					<p>Music has some (of many more) basic properties:</p>
					<ul class="list-disc pl-4 space-y-2 mb-10">
						<li>
							<span class="underline">Pitch</span>: It is a purely psychological
							construct. It answers us the question "What note is that?" "Is it
							high or low?" The terms <span class="italic">note</span> and
							<span class="italic">tone</span> refer to the same thing in the
							abstract sense but note is written and tone is heard.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="underline">Rhythm</span>: It refers to the duration
							of a series of notes and the way the series groups in a particular
							way.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="underline">Tempo</span>: This refers to the overall
							speed or pace of the music. If you were to tap your foot to it how
							fast or slow these regular the taps would be.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="underline">Timbre</span>: It is the tonal colour of
							the sound. This is what differentiates a trumpet from a flute when
							both are playing the same note. Timbre arises from overtones
							present in the sound. Read more about it here

						<li>
							<span class="underline">Loudness</span>: It is psychological
							construct relating to how much energy an instrument produces or
							the air it displace or how intense is the sound?
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mb-10">
						Music judges two individual notes only by their mutual relations.
						Consonance is the perceived pleasantness to the certain musical
						relations. Consonant intervals have a high degree of frequency
						matching which creates a smooth and a stable sound. Two tones with
						lower frequency matching results to dissonance which is not pleasant
						to the ears. The mismatch in the frequencies is what gives them
						their unstable quality. The ratio of the matching frequencies must
						be as close to a whole number. Our brains are less attuned to
						perceiving the dissonant frequencies as pleasant.
