						नाद comes from the root Sanskrit word नद् meaning a sound or noise,
						typically a loud or resounding one. नद् comes from the early
						Proto-Indo-European *ned- “to sound, roar, bellow”, which might be
						sound-symbolic. The root *ned- is sound-symbolic because it refers
						to things that create sounds, like roaring rivers or reeds that make
						a noise when the wind moves through them. The words connected to
						ned- are all about sound or things that make sound!

						As per Hindu cosmogony, when ब्रह्मा (Brahmā), the god of creation
						and one of the त्रिमूर्ति (Trimurti)—the holy trinity alongside
						विष्णु (Vishnu), the preserver, and शिव (Shiva), the
						destroyer—created the ब्रह्माण्ड (Brahmāṇḍ), the cosmos, there was
						nothing but sound: नाद (Nāda).
						<br />
						नाद ब्रह्मा (Nāda Brahmā) is a philosophical concept that represents
						the primordial, unstruck sound, from which all other sounds are
						believed to emanate. Nāda Brahmā could be seen as the first
						causation of sound, representing the original or primal sound that
						gives rise to all subsequent manifestations in the universe. This is
						called अनाहत नाद (Anāhat Nāda) which is heard when the Atmān
						(spirit/soul) merges with the absolute Brahmā. All other sound is
						called आहत नाद (Āhat Nāda), created by the collision of, or the
						friction between two objects. According to Mataṅga Muni a seventh
						century music commentator स्वर (swar) - the musical note is a sound
						that glows on its own. Swa (स्व) meaning self and ra means rajari -
						luminous. Indians thus associate sound and by extension music with
						the divine.

					<h3 class="text-lg">Origins: The Aural Tradition</h3>
					<br />
					<p class="mb-10">
						The Indian tradition is primarily an oral tradition. The holy
						scriptures of Hindus, the Vedas (वेद), are known as Śruti (श्रुति),
						meaning "that which is heard." These ancient texts were passed down
						through generations by oral recitation before being finally written
						down by वेद व्यास (Veda Vyāsa).
						<span class="italic text-sm"
							>[The Vedas are considered to be divinely revealed texts in the
							Hindu tradition, and they were not composed by any single
							individual. Instead, they are believed to have been revealed to
							the ancient sages or rishis through direct spiritual experience,
							often described as "śruti" (that which is heard). The Vedas were
							passed down orally from generation to generation and were
							eventually written down.]</span
						>
						The unique process by which this music has been kept alive over the
						centuries is through the aural guild tradition referred to as the
						गुरु-शिष्य परंपरा (Guru-Śiṣya Paramparā). The codification,
						notation, standardisation, and some form of formalisation that we
						see today only happened in the 20<sup>th</sup>
						century. Before that this knowledge was transferred from father to
						son, and from teacher to pupil by word of mouth. The origin of
						Indian music goes back to 1500BCE (~3000 years ago) with the chants
						and hymns of the Vedic people. Chants a system of musical notes
						along with the rhythmic cycles goes back to सामवेद (Sāma Veda)
						composed between 1500-1200BCE. सामवेद is called the veda of music
						and provides the foundation for Indian classical music. The सामवेद
						consists of hymns from ऋग्वेद (Ṛigveda) set to melodies. Sāman
						(सामन) refers to a type of melodic chant or hymn used in the Vedic
						rituals. It is specifically the musical aspect of the Vedic hymns.
						The Sāma Veda is largely composed of Sāman chants, which are melodic
						renderings of hymns found in the Rig Veda. सामन (Sāman) hymns were
						created by setting the verses from the Rig Veda to specific tunes or
						melodies, and these melodies were intended to be sung during Vedic
						rituals particularly sacrifices. The practice of chanting सामन was
						important because it not only conveyed the meaning of the hymns but
						also added a musical element to the rituals. The melodies and
						rhythms were believed to enhance the potency of the rituals and
						invoke the divine forces effectively.
						<br />
						<br />
						During the ancient times two genres of the music prevailed: गन्धर्व
						(Gandharva) and गान (Gāna). गन्धर्व was the music composed to be
						performed during rituals and was considered celestial and divine.
						गान was the informal and improvised music for entertainment
						purposes. The first reference to music can be credited to पाणिनि
						(Pāṇini), an ancient Indian grammarian (500BCE). His work,
						अष्टाध्यायी (Aṣṭādhyāyī), is a comprehensive treatise on Sanskrit
						grammar and includes references to various aspects of language,
						including phonetics, sound patterns, and music. contains references
						to musical sounds, rhythm, and pitch, reflecting the early
						recognition of the connection between language and sound. In his
						work, he mentions various स्वर (svara), which means sound, tone, or
						note. These notes or sounds are foundational to the study of music.
						The ancient classical text, नाट्यशास्त्र (Nāṭyaśāstra) [believed to
						have been written between 200 BCE and 200 CE however, the exact date
						of its composition is not definitively known] by भारत मुनि (Bharata
						Muni), is the foundation of numerous classical music and dance
						traditions of India. It was the first musical work written in format
						that divided music into 22 keys called श्रुति (Śruti).
