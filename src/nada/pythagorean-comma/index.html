					we multiply ratios, because ratios are, by definition, meant to be
					multiplied. One octave is 2:1, two octaves are 4:1, three octave are
					8:1, four octaves are 16:1. That's cold, hard fact. What happens is
					that, following just intonation, four stacked major thirds DO NOT
					EQUAL to an octave, and twelve consecutive perfect fifths DO NOT EQUAL
					to seven octaves. That's been a well known fact for... a few
					centuries, I believe? Look up the Pythagorean comma. However, if you
					follow equal temperament, then three major thirds do equal an octave,
					and that's because a major third isn't 5:4; it's 2^(3/12):1, which,
					when multiplied by itself 4 times, does equal 2.
