						<span class="italic">Timbre</span> comes from old French meaning
						"bell" or "drum," which later came to mean "sound" or "tone" and is
						pronounced \TAM-ber\ with a more French influenced second syllable
						\TAM-bruh\. Timbre initially meant a drum and came to French from
						Greek word <span class="italic">τύμπανον (týmpanon)</span> meaning
						“kettledrum”.
						<br />
						Sound has 2 (among some others) really basic characteristics:
						<span class="underline"
							>Pitch (frequency) and Loudness (amplitude)</span
						>.
						<br />
						Pitch is purely psychological construct which relates to the actual
						frequency of a particular sound. Loudness too is a purely
						psychological construct that relates to how much energy a source of
						sound creates: how much air it displaces when the sound is made.
						When I say psychological construct what I mean is they only exist in
						our minds and do not exist in nature on their own. Our minds bring
						pitch and loudness in to reality.
						<br />
						The sounds you just played specifically middle C4 is a musical note
						with a frequency of <span class="italic">261.63Hz</span>. C4 has a
						scientific frequency of <span class="italic">256Hz</span> which uses
						mathematical ways to measure the frequency while the musical pitch
						of 261.63Hz is used my musicians for tuning their instruments. All
						the 4 instruments piano, trumpet, violin, and flute are playing the
						same frequency of 261.63Hz but yet they sound different. When they
						play the note the sound vibrations are oscillating at approximately
						262Hz and yet they sound different.
						<br />
						<span class="italic">Why?</span>
						<br />
						Let's find out
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						Nearly all objects when hit, pluck, strummed or somehow disturbed
						vibrate. The frequency at which the objects vibrate is called its
						<span class="italic">natural frequency</span>. Let's take an example
						of a string instrument like a guitar. When you pluck a guitar string
						it vibrates along it full length at a frequency called the
						<span class="italic">fundamental frequency</span> also called as the
						<span class="italic">first harmonic</span>. So in case of a middle
						C4 the string vibrates approximately 262 times per second (Hertz).
						This vibration at the fundamental frequency gives the guitar string
						it's base pitch which we hear. The frequency is determined by
						various factors and each of the factors affect either the wavelength
						of the object since
						<span class="italic">frequency = speed / wavelength</span>. For a
						guitar with 6 strings the factors include the linear density of the
						strings (wider strings are more dense), different tension of the
						strings, and the different length of the strings. The speed at which
						a wave travels through a string depends on the properties of the
						medium -- tension and linear density. Changes in these properties
						affect the natural frequency of the string.

					<p class="mb-10">
						So when a guitarist plucks a string of a guitar the plucking
						transfers energy to the string and it starts to vibrate. The
						disturbance travels in both the directions. Since the string is
						fixed by the frets on one side and the bridge on the other the
						string is unable to move and once the disturbance travels from one
						end to the other and is reflected back to travel in the opposite
						direction. When the disturbance travels back it
						<span class="italic">interferes</span> with the forward moving
						disturbance (wave). These points are called
						<span class="italic">nodes</span> -- the points of no displacement.
						In between two nodes there has to be an
						<span class="italic">antinode</span>. The fundamental frequency of
						the string is associated with one antinode between the two nodes.
						The string vibrates in such a way that the displacement is zero at
						both ends (nodes), and there is a maximum displacement at the center
						of the string (an antinode). The string vibrates with the lowest
						frequency possible, corresponding to the longest wavelength that
						fits within the string's length.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						In comes <span class="italic">resonance</span>. The string has a
						natural set of frequencies at which it vibrates most strongly. These
						natural frequencies are the
						<span class="font-bold">fundamental</span> and its
						<span class="font-bold">harmonics</span>. Every string has specific
						frequencies at which it naturally vibrates based on its:
					</p>
					<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
						<li>
							Length: The longer the string, the lower the fundamental
							frequency.
						</li>
						<li>
							Tension: The tighter the string, the higher the frequencies.
						</li>
						<li>
							Mass per unit length: Heavier strings vibrate at lower
							frequencies.
						</li>
					</ol>

					</div>
					<p>
						These are called the string's resonant frequencies. When you pluck
						the string, it will vibrate at one or more of these resonant
						frequencies, and this is where resonance occurs. The string has
						natural resonant frequencies that it
						<span class="italic">“prefers”</span> to vibrate at. These are not
						just at the fundamental frequency, but at integer multiples of that
						frequency. These higher frequencies are called harmonics or
						<span class="italic">overtones</span>. The string can also vibrate
						in more complex modes by dividing the string into sections. Each
						section vibrates independently at a higher frequency. These modes of
						vibration occur at specific frequencies where the string fits an
						integer number of half-wavelengths along its length.

						So when a guitar string is plucked it's vibrating at a fundamental
						frequency and also at its resonating frequencies giving rise to
						harmonics and a rich set of frequencies.
					</p>
					<p class="my-5">
						For a string fixed at both ends:
						<br />
						<span class="underline"
							>Fundamental Frequency (1<sup>st</sup> harmonic):</span
						>
						The standing wave has 1 antinode in the middle and 2 nodes at the
						ends. The wavelength is twice the length of the string. Relation:
						λ<sub>1</sub> = 2L
						<br />
						<span class="underline">2<sup>nd</sup> harmonic:</span>
						The standing wave has 2 antinodes and 3 nodes (nodes at both ends,
						one in the middle, and two between them). The wavelength is the
						length of the string. Relation: λ<sub>2</sub> = L
						<br />
						<span class="underline">3<sup>rd</sup> harmonic:</span>
						The standing wave has 3 antinodes and 4 nodes The wavelength is the
						length of the string. Relation: λ<sub>3</sub> = 2L/3
						<br />
						<span class="underline">n<sup>th</sup> Harmonic:</span>
						The standing wave has n antinodes and n+1 nodes. The wavelength for
						the nth harmonic is given by:
						<span class="italic">λ<sub>n</sub> = 2L/n</span>

						The same logic can be applied to the wind instruments. Open pipes
						(e.g. flutes, recorders) open at both ends, these instruments
						produce all harmonics (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). The fundamental
						frequency (f<sub>1</sub>) is supported, along with integer
						multiples:
						<span class="italic">f<sub>2</sub> = 2f<sub>1</sub></span>
						<span class="italic">f<sub>3</sub> = 3f<sub>1</sub></span> and so
						on. In an open pipe, both ends act as antinodes, where the air
						vibrates with maximum amplitude. The relationship between the
						wavelength (λ), frequency (f), and the length (L) of the pipe is
						given by: <span class="italic">L = nλ/2</span>
						<span class="italic">f = nv/L</span> where: <br />
						n = Harmonic number (1st harmonic, 2nd harmonic, etc.).
						<br />
						v = Speed of sound in air (≈343 m/s at room temperature)
						<br />
						<br />
						Closed pipes (e.g. clarinets, organ pipes) closed at one end, these
						instruments produce only odd harmonics (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.). The
						fundamental frequency (f<sub>1</sub>) is supported, and higher
						harmonics are odd multiples:
						<span class="italic">f<sub>3</sub> = 3f<sub>1</sub></span>
						<span class="italic">f<sub>5</sub> = 5f<sub>1</sub></span> and so
						on. In a closed pipe, the closed end acts as a node (no air
						movement), and the open end acts as an antinode (maximum air
						movement). The relationship between the wavelength (λ), frequency
						(f), and the length (L) is: <span class="italic">L = nλ/4</span>
						<span class="italic">f = nv/4L</span> where: <br />
						n = Harmonic number (1st harmonic, 2nd harmonic, etc.).
						<br />
						v = Speed of sound in air
						<br />
						<br />
						Brass instruments with valves or slides (e.g., Trumpets, Trombones)
						rely on the player's lips to excite the air column, producing a mix
						of harmonics. The harmonic series depends on the length of the tube,
						which is modified by valves or slides.

						So when you're playing a piano C4 or a trumpet C4 or a violin C4 or
						a flute C4 which is a frequency of 261.63Hz there are innumerable
						frequencies being generated which are called harmonics. If you look
						at the second visualisation at the start and play one of the sounds
						you can see all the harmonics being generated and represented as a
						graph. These rich set of harmonics give an instrument its
						<span class="font-bold">timbre</span>.
