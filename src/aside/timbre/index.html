						<span class="italic">Timbre</span> comes from old French meaning
						"bell" or "drum," which later came to mean "sound" or "tone" and is
						pronounced \TAM-ber\ with a more French influenced second syllable
						\TAM-bruh\. Timbre initially meant a drum and came to French from
						Greek word <span class="italic">τύμπανον (týmpanon)</span> meaning
						“kettledrum”.
						<br />
						Sound has 2 (among some others) really basic characteristics:
						<span class="underline"
							>Pitch (frequency) and Loudness (amplitude)</span
						>.
						<br />
						Pitch is purely psychological construct which relates to the actual
						frequency of a particular sound. Loudness too is a purely
						psychological construct that relates to how much energy a source of
						sound creates: how much air it displaces when the sound is made.
						When I say psychological construct what I mean is they only exist in
						our minds and do not exist in nature on their own. Our minds bring
						pitch and loudness to reality.
						<br />
						The sounds you just played specifically middle C4 is a musical note
						with a frequency of <span class="italic">261.63Hz</span>. C4 has a
						scientific frequency of <span class="italic">256Hz</span> which uses
						mathematical ways to measure the frequency while the musical pitch
						of 261.63Hz is used my musicians for tuning their instruments. All
						the 4 instruments piano, trumpet, violin, and flute are playing the
						same frequency of 261.63Hz but yet they sound different. When they
						play the note the sound vibrations are oscillating at approximately
						262Hz and yet they sound different.
						<br />
						<span class="italic">Why?</span>
						<br />
						Let's find out why?
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						<span class="italic underline">Harmonic content</span>
						<br />
						Nearly all objects when hit, pluck, strummed or somehow disturbed
						vibrate. The frequency at which the objects vibrate is called its
						<span class="italic">natural frequency</span>. Let's take an example
						of a string instrument like a guitar. When you pluck a guitar string
						it vibrates along it full length at a frequency called the
						<span class="italic">fundamental frequency</span> also called as the
						<span class="italic">first harmonic</span>. So in case of a middle
						C4 the string vibrates approximately 262 times per second (Hertz).
						This vibration at the fundamental frequency gives the guitar string
						it's base pitch which we hear. The frequency is determined by
						various factors and each of the factors affect either the wavelength
						of the object since
						<span class="italic">frequency = speed / wavelength</span>. For a
						guitar with 6 strings the factors include the linear density of the
						strings (wider strings are more dense), different tension of the
						strings, and the different length of the strings. The speed at which
						a wave travels through a string depends on the properties of the
						medium -- tension and linear density. Changes in these properties
						affect the natural frequency of the string.

					<p class="mb-10">
						So when a guitarist plucks a string of a guitar the plucking
						transfers energy to the string and it starts to vibrate. The
						disturbance travels in both the directions. Since the string is
						fixed by the frets on one side and the bridge on the other the
						string is unable to move and once the disturbance travels from one
						end to the other and is reflected back to travel in the opposite
						direction. When the disturbance travels back it
						<span class="italic">interferes</span> with the forward moving
						disturbance (wave). These points are called
						<span class="italic">nodes</span> -- the points of no displacement.
						In between two nodes there has to be an
						<span class="italic">antinode</span>. The fundamental frequency of
						the string is associated with one antinode between the two nodes.
						The string vibrates in such a way that the displacement is zero at both ends (nodes), and there is a maximum displacement at the center of the string (an antinode).
						The string vibrates with the lowest frequency possible, corresponding to the longest wavelength that fits within the string's length.

					<p class="mb-5">
						In comes <span class="italic">resonance</span>. The string has a natural set of frequencies at which it vibrates most strongly. These natural frequencies are the <span class="font-bold">fundamental</span> and its <span class="font-bold">harmonics</span>.
						Every string has specific frequencies at which it naturally vibrates based on its:
						<ol class="mb-5 list-decimal px-8">
							<li>
								Length: The longer the string, the lower the fundamental frequency.
							</li>
							<li>
								Tension: The tighter the string, the higher the frequencies.
							</li>
							<li>
								Mass per unit length: Heavier strings vibrate at lower frequencies.
							</li>
						</ol>
						These are called the string's resonant frequencies. When you pluck the string, it will vibrate at one or more of these resonant frequencies, and this is where resonance occurs.
						The string has natural resonant frequencies that it <span class="italic">“prefers”</span> to vibrate at. These are not just at the fundamental frequency, but at integer multiples of that frequency.
						These higher frequencies are called harmonics or <span class="italic">overtones</span>. The string can also vibrate in more complex modes by dividing the string into sections. Each section vibrates independently at a higher frequency.
						These modes of vibration occur at specific frequencies where the string fits an integer number of half-wavelengths along its length.
