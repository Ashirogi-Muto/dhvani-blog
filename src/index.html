						What is sound?
					</h2>
					<p>
						Sound is nothing but the changes in the air pressure caused by any
						kind of disturbance in our surrounding. For eg. if you hit a tuning
						fork it creates a disturbance in the air pressure and when that
						disturbance reaches us our brains translate that change in pressure
						to sound. Sound is a natural accoustic phenomenon of vibrations
						moving usually through air (or any kind of medium) to our ears.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ok let's try to visualise what happens when a tuning fork is hit.
					</p>
					<div class="flex justify-center my-10">

							class="max-w-full h-auto"
						/>
					</div>
					<p>
						When the prongs of a tuning fork vibrate, they disturb the air
						particles around them. When the prongs move apart, they push against
						the neighboring air particles, causing compression. In this
						compressed region, the particles are forced closer together,
						increasing the air pressure. This compression represents the "push"
						of the wave but does not involve air particles traveling with the
						wave only their vibrations about their mean positions. When the
						prongs move back to their original position, the compressed air
						expands, causing the air particles to move slightly away from each
						other, resulting in rarefaction a region of lower pressure. The
						particles return to their original positions but continue to
						oscillate, contributing to the wave's propagation. Air particles
						don't move with the sound wave because sound is a mechanical wave
						(meaning it needs a medium to travel), and mechanical waves transfer
						<span class="font-bold">energy</span>, not matter.
					</p>
					<div class="flex justify-center my-10">
						<img
							src="/assets/tuning_fork_2.gif"
							alt="tuning fork compression and rarefaction gif"
							class="max-w-full h-auto"
						/>
					</div>
					<p>
						Because of this motion of the air particles due to the vibrations
						from the tuning fork there are regions where the air particles are
						compressed together and other regions where the air particles are
						spread apart. These regions are called compressions and rarefactions
						respectively. The alternate compression and rarefaction form on the
						same point, there is no migration of the particles. Sound results
						from this mechanical wave caused by the back and forth movement of
						the particles through a medium.

						If you could see sound waves, it would look more like what happens
						when you blow up a large beach ball. Imagine that you blow into a
						beach ball and it expands outwards in a spherical shape. When you
						take your mouth off the nozzle to take another breath the ball
						slightly deflates. As you blow the next breath into it the ball
						expands again and slightly deflates when you take the next breath,
						and so on until the ball is completely inflated. In a similar manner
						sound propagates away from the source in a sphere moving outward and
						then recoiling inward and then outward and so on.

						How do we perceive sounds?
					</h1>
					<p>
						On the level of physics what we call sound is a vibration or
						referring an old word "verberation". This is a wave that following
						the shaking movement of one or more sources propagate and reaches
						our ears where it gives rise to auditory sensations. Physically
						speaking sound is the shaking movement of the medium in question.
						Sound propagates in concentric cirlces similar to ripples seen on
						throwing a rock into calm waters. In the air the
						<span class="italic">verberation</span>
						propagates at a speed of approximately 343 meters per second. It was
						only at the beginning of the nineteenth century that this average
						speed of sound which varies slightly relative to pressure and
						temperature was able to be calculated. In water the wave propagates
						considerably faster (1500 m/s). Sound also travels through hard
						material and this is the reason why it is so hard to soundproof
						apartments that are located on top of the other. Sound in the
						<span class="italic">physical</span> sense has only two
						characteristics: <span class="underline">frequency</span> the number
						of oscillations (or vibrations) per second and
						<span class="underline">pressure amplitude</span> which correlates
						to the magnitude of the oscillation. Frequency is perceived as pitch
						and the amplitude is perceived as sonic intensity (loudness). All of
						the other perceived characteristics of sound are produced by
						variations of frequency and amplitude over time. The sound
						propagation takes place in every direction and it weakens in
						proportion to thr square of the distance traveled. There is a
						reflection when the
						<span class="italic">verberation</span> encounters a surface that
						does not absorb it completely and returns a portion of it like a
						bouncing ball. Weh we hear sound via direct propagation from the
						source and a reflected sound the lag between the direct sound and
						reflected sound combine to produce
						<span class="italic">reverberations</span>. When a sound wave
						encounters an obstacle a portion will bypass it and this is called
						diffraction. Diffraction is what makes acoustic isolation difficult
						to achieve.

						The ears detect, analyse, and classify biologically interesting
						sounds and construct a model of auditory scene that surrounds us.
						The auditory system is attuned not only to listen to certain sounds
						but to ignore sounds that are not biologically relevant. Such sounds
						include ambient noises and the effects of sound reflection,
						refraction, diffusion which can distort the incoming sound. Imagine
						that you stretch a pillowcase tightly across the opening of a bucket
						and people throw balls at it from different distances. Each person
						can throw as many balls as they like and as often they like. Now
						your job is to figure out just by looking at how the pillowcase
						moves uop and down, how many people are there, who they are, and
						whether they are walking towards you, away from you or are standing
						still. This is what our auditory system has to do when making
						identification of auditory objects in the world using only the
						movement of the eardrum as a guide. (Of course the brain combines
						the data received through the eyes to form a holistic model of the
						current environment.)

					<p class="mb-10">
						Human ear is an organ which is external and internal at the same
						time. The ear as an organ is divided into outer, middle and inner.
						The outer ear consist if the <span class="italic">pinna</span>, the
						auditory or the ear canal and the eardrum.
						<span class="italic">Pinna</span> helps with protection (from wind
						and other things that might interfere with audition) and
						<span class="italic">resonance</span>. The funnel shaped
						<span class="italic">pinna</span> collects sound from the
						environment and its shape modifies the arriving frequency
						information depending on the direction of the source. The
						<span class="italic">pinna</span> directs the waves towards the
						tympanic membrane and its form favours frequencies that we use in
						verbal communication. The ear canal of the human adult is on average
						7 to 8 millimeters in diameter and 2.5 to 3 centimeters deep. Its
						structure also tends to attenuate sounds that impede verbal
						communication mainly bass frequencies. Frequencies around 3000Hz are
						transferred more efficiently by the canal and we are more sensitive
						to this range of frequencies. The eardrum is bent by the force of
						arriving sound and transmits the motion to the middle ear. It
						vibrates more easily between 1-3.5kHz frequency range but transmits
						sounds to the inner ear over the entire audible frequency range. The
						ear drum and the middle ear play a crucial role in overcoming the
						mismatch between the low density air in the outer ear and the much
						of the denser fluid in the inner ear with a process called impedance
						matching. Impedance refers to the resistance a medium offers to the
						flow of energy. Air has low impedance while the fluid in the inner
						ear has high impedance. Without a mechanism to fix this mismatch
						sound waves sound waves mostly be reflected back when they hit the
						fluid in the inner ear. This would reduce the amount of sound energy
						entering the inner ear making hearing inefficient. Normally, when
						sound travels from a low impedance medium like air to a high
						impedance medium like water almost all of the acoustical energy is
						reflected. We still have very low understanding of how the eardrum
						accomplishes this task over such a wide frequency range.

						The middle ear is primarily made up of tympanic membrane and the
						series of tiny bones called
						<span class="italic">ossicles</span> that go by the names of
						"hammer" (incus), "anvil" (malleus), and "stirrup" (stapes). The
						bones function to transfer the pressure vibrations into mechanical
						vibrations which are passed along to the entrance of cochlea which
						is called the oval window. The tympanic membrane (eardrum)
						approximately one centimeter in diameter is an elastic membrane is
						in contact with these ossicles. This series of little bones transmit
						the vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear while
						amplifying the frequencies between 1000 and 4000Hz. It is here that
						the bones protect against the sounds that are too loud with a
						mechanism called acoustic reflex (also called the stapedius reflex
						or middle ear reflex). Not only does this mechanism protect us from
						loud sounds, it also dulls the loudness of our own voices when we
						speak. It involves tiny muscles attached to the ossicles that
						respond to the loud sounds by reducing the movement of the bones
						thus limiting the amount of energy transmitted to the inner ear. The
						stapedius muscle and the tensor tympani muscle contract reflexively
						with in 10-20 ms in response to loud sound pressures exceeding
						70-100dB SPL (Sound Pressure Level). When these muscles contract
						they dampen the movement of the ossciles which stiffens the
						ossicular chain reducing the transmission of the sound vibrations
						reaching the inner ear. By stiffening the ossicles, the reflex
						reduces the intensity of the sound that reaches the cochlea by
						approximately 20 decibels.

						The inner ear consists of organs that help with balance and
						audition. The audition is handled by
						<span class="italic">cochlea</span> Greek for "snail" due to its
						coiled shape. The stapes connects to the
						<span class="italic">oval window</span> at one end of the
						<span class="italic">cochlea</span> a fluid filled tube that
						connects to the auditory nerve. The other end is called a
						<span class="italic">round window</span>. The side of the oval
						window is called the <span class="italic">scala vestibuli</span> and
						the side of round window is called
						<span class="italic">scala tympani</span> The two scala are filled
						with <span class="italic">perilymph</span> a fluid similar to spinal
						fluid. The vibrations from the stapes to the oval window moves the
						fluid back and forth. The round window has a flexible membrane and
						acts as a pressure release point bulging outward when the fluid
						moves. The two scala enclose the
						<span class="italic">scala media</span> filled with
						<span class="italic">endolymph</span> which is similar to
						intracellular fluid. Within the scala media is the organ of
						<span class="italic">Corti</span> which rests on the
						<span class="italic">basilar membrane</span> and contains
						specialised sensory cells called hair cells. It includes 3 rows of
						outer hair cells and 1 row of inner hair cells.

					<p class="mb-10">
						The basilar membrane runs down the center of cochlea. About 30,000
						hair cells are attached to it along the length. (Note: this is the
						same hair cells we talked about in organ of Corti). The membrane is
						thinner at the base close to the oval window and round window. This
						thinner end vibrates more at high frequencies than its thicker end
						which is at its apex. Low frequencies vibrate the perilymph more
						intensely at the apex of the membrane.
						<span class="italic font-bold"
							>The position along the membrane encodes frequency required for
							audition.</span
						>
						As the membrane moves it causes the hair cells in the organ of Corti
						to bend. The top of these hair cells have tiny hair-like structures
						called <span class="italic">stereocilia</span>. When these bend they
						open ion channels leading to an electrical signal being generated.
						There are mechano-sensitive ion channels at the tips of the
						stereocilia and these channels are sensitive to mechanical
						deformation. On bending the tips stretch which pulls the channel
						open. This allows potassium ions (K<su>+</su>) which are abundant in
						the fluid endolymph to flow into the hair cell. This influx of
						potassium ions into the hair cell caused the inside of the cell to
						become depolarized (less negatively charged) which triggers the
						opening of voltage gated calcium channels in the hair cell membrane.
						Calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) from the perilymph enter the hair
						cells and this leads to the release of the neurotransmitters from
						the hair cell into the spiral ganglion neuron which relay the
						signals from the inner ear to the brain stem. After the initial
						bending of the stereocilia, if the stereocilia bend back in the
						opposite direction, the ion channels close and the hair cell becomes
						hyperpolarized (more negatively charged). This shuts down the inflow
						of ions, halting the release of neurotransmitters and stopping the
						generation of action potentials.

						Ok so the ears have processed the pressure waves, turned them into
						electrical signals, and transmitted them to the brain but how does
						the brain turn these signals into sound? Let's try to make sense of
						that by taking the example of music (organised sound).
					</p>
					<p class="mb-10">
						The human brain is divided up into four lobes: the frontal,
						temporal, parietal, and occipital plus the cerebellum. The temporal
						lobe is associated with hearing and memory. The cerebellum, the
						oldest evolutionary part of the human brain going back to the
						reptilian brain is involved in emotions and the planning of
						movements. Different aspects of the music are processed by different
						parts of the brain and the brain uses functional segregation for
						processing it and uses a system of feature detectors to analyse
						specific aspects like pitch, timbre, tempo, etc. Brains are complex
						computational systems and networks of interconnected neurons perform
						computations which leads to thoughts, perceptions and ultimately
						consciousness. The average brain consists of one hundred billion
						(100,000,000,000) neurons, this is a lot of neurons but the real
						complexity arises through their connections. The formula for how n
						number of neurons can be connected to each other is 2<sup
							>(n* (n-1)/2)</sup
						>.
						<br />
						For 2 neurons there are 2 possibilities for how they can be
						connected
						<br />
						For 3 neurons there are 8 possibilities
						<br />
						For 4 neurons there are 64 possibilities
						<br />
						For 5 neurons there are 1024 possibilities
						<br />
						For 6 neurons there are 32,768 possibilities
						<br />
						The number of combinations possible for an average brain is HUGE!
						Much of the computational power comes from this enormous possibility
						for interconnections and the fact that brains are serial processors
						unlike computers which are parallel processors.
