					I am putting down all my thoughts and learnings from my journey into

					been exploring sounds for the past
					<span id="time-elapsed"></span> spending a lot of time just reading

					<h2 class="text-3xl">What is sound?</h2>
					<p>
						Sound is nothing but the changes in the air pressure caused by any
						kind of disturbance in our surrounding. For eg. if you hit a tuning
						fork it creates a disturbance in the air pressure and when that
						disturbance reaches us our brains translate that change in pressure
						to sound. Sound is a natural accoustic phenomenon of vibrations
						moving usually through air (or any kind of medium) to our ears.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ok let's try to visualise what happens when a tuning fork is hit.
					</p>
					<div class="flex justify-center">

							alt="tuning fork compression and rarefaction"
							class="max-w-full h-auto"
						/>
					</div>
					<p>
						When the prongs of a tuning fork vibrate, they disturb the air
						particles around them. When the prongs move apart, they push against
						the neighboring air particles, causing compression. In this
						compressed region, the particles are forced closer together,
						increasing the air pressure. This compression represents the "push"
						of the wave but does not involve air particles traveling with the
						wave—only their vibrations about their mean positions. When the
						prongs move back to their original position, the compressed air
						expands, causing the air particles to move slightly away from each
						other, resulting in rarefaction—a region of lower pressure. The
						particles return to their original positions but continue to
						oscillate, contributing to the wave's propagation. Air particles
						don't move with the sound wave because sound is a mechanical wave
						(meaning it needs a medium to travel), and mechanical waves transfer
						<span class="font-bold">energy</span>, not matter.
					</p>
					<div class="flex justify-center">
						<img
							src="/assets/tuning_fork_2.gif"
							alt="tuning fork compression and rarefaction gif"
							class="max-w-full h-auto"
						/>
					</div>
					<p>
						Because of this motion of the air particles due to the vibrations
						from the tuning fork there are regions where the air particles are
						compressed together and other regions where the air particles are
						spread apart. These regions are called compressions and rarefactions
						respectively. The alternate compression and rarefaction form on the
						same point, there is no migration of the particles. Sound results
						from this mechanical wave caused by the back and forth movement of
						the particles through a medium.

						If you could see sound waves, it would look more like what happens
						when you blow up a large beach ball. Imagine that you blow into a
						beach ball and it expands outwards in a spherical shape. When you
						take your mouth off the nozzle to take another breath the ball
						slightly deflates. As you blow the next breath into it the ball
						expands again and slightly deflates when you take the next breath,
						and so on until the ball is completely inflated. In a similar manner
						sound propagates away from the source in a sphere moving outward and
						then recoiling inward and then outward and so on.

					<h1 class="text-3xl">How do we perceive sounds?</h1>
					<p>
						On the level of physics what we call sound is a vibration or
						referring an old word "verberation". This is a wave that following
						the shaking movement of one or more sources propagate and reaches
						our ears where it gives rise to auditory sensations. Physically
						speaking sound is the shaking movement of the medium in question.
						Sound propagates in concentric cirlces similar to ripples seen on
						throwing a rock into calm waters. In the air the verberation
						propagates at a speed of approximately 343 meters per second. It was
						only at the beginning of the nineteenth century that this average
						speed of sound which varies slightly relative to pressure and
						temperature was able to be calculated. In water the wave propagates
						considerably faster (15oo m/s). Sound also travels through hard
						material and this is the reason why it is so hard to soundproof
						apartments that are located on top of the other. Sound in the
						<span class="italic">physical</span> sense has only two
						characteristics: <span class="underline">frequency</span> the number
						of oscillations (or vibrations) per second and
						<span class="underline">pressure amplitude</span> which correlates
						to the magnitude of the oscillation. Frequency is perceived as pitch
						and the amplitude is perceived as sonic intensity (loudness).
